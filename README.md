# ***TIC-TAC-TOE GAME***

My Project is the well-known Tic-Tac-Toe which is widely played across the world. It involves placing an `‘X’ (cross)` or a `‘O’ (nought)` in one box of the `3x3 grid` or `4x4 grid`(for multi player game) in each turn of the player. We have made use of `Tkinter` for making the GUI for our game. My project accommodates both `single player` (person VSs computer) and `multi-players` (person1 vs person 2) options. In multi-player option there is a choice to play a 3x3 or 4x4 game. After the game it displays which `player/Comp won` the game and if it was a tie it gives a message – `Tie game`.
